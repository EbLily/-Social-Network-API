 ## Overview 

 The Challenge:

 The challenge was to build a RESTful API that allows a social media startup to perform CRUD operations on users,thoughts, and reactions data models using a NoSQL database.

 API must allow users to :

 Create, update  and delete user accounts.
 Create, read, update and delete thoughts.
 Add and remove friends to a user's friend list.
 Add and remove reactions to thoughts.

 ## User Story 
 
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Usage 
1. Open a terminal and run npm i and npm run dev 
2. Once the server is runing on port 3001, use insomina to test the API endpoints
3. Use insomnia to test http://localhost:3001, and you can test endpoints API GET,
POST,PUT,and DELETE.
